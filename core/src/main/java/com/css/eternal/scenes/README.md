# Scenes Folder Description

The **Scenes** folder is an essential part of our game's architecture, designed to store scene objects. These objects are versatile components that can be instantiated within any screen, providing a flexible and reusable way to manage game elements.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Scene objects are modular, enabling them to be reused across different screens without redundancy.
- **Event Listening**: Scenes can be connected to screen event listeners, facilitating interactive and responsive gameplay.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Once initialized, scenes can be drawn onto screens, enhancing the visual and functional aspects of the game.

This folder structure promotes organized development and efficient management of game scenes, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.
