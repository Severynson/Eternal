# Domain Folder Description

The **domain** folder is a crucial component of our application's architecture, housing the core business logic and domain models. This folder is designed to encapsulate the essential rules, processes, and data structures that define the application's functionality.

## Key Components

### 1. Business Logic

The domain folder contains classes and interfaces that represent the core business logic of the application. This includes:

- **Rules and Processes**: Define the operations and workflows that drive the application's behavior.
- **Data Structures**: Organize and manage the data essential to the application's operations.

### 2. Domain Models

This folder often includes domain models or entities, which are classes that represent the key objects and concepts within the application's domain. Examples include:

- **Dialogue**: Represents conversations or interactions within the game.
- **Player**: Defines the attributes and behaviors of the player character.
- **Enemy**: Models adversaries or obstacles the player may encounter.
- **Item**: Represents objects that can be collected or used by the player.

## Purpose and Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: By isolating domain logic, we maintain a clear separation between business rules and other application layers, such as the user interface or data access.
- **Reusability and Maintainability**: Centralizing domain logic facilitates easier updates and maintenance, promoting code reuse across different parts of the application.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Aligns with Domain-Driven Design principles, ensuring that the application behaves according to the domain's rules and constraints.

This structured approach ensures a scalable and maintainable codebase, allowing for efficient development and management of the application's core functionality.
