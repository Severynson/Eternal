# Utils Folder Documentation

The **utils** folder is a dedicated space within our project designed to house utility classes. These classes play a crucial role in encapsulating and processing complex logic that supports various aspects of the application. The utilities provided here are essential for tasks that involve data transformation, system interactions, and network communications.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the utils folder is to:

- **Encapsulate Complex Logic**: Provide reusable solutions for common tasks that require intricate logic, ensuring that the main application code remains clean and focused.
- **Data Transformation**: Offer utilities for converting and manipulating data types, facilitating seamless data handling across different parts of the application.
- **System Interaction**: Include classes that interact with the underlying system, such as file handling, environment configuration, and system resource management.
- **Network Communication**: Provide tools for handling HTTP(S) requests and responses, enabling efficient and reliable communication with external services.

## Key Benefits

- **Reusability**: By centralizing utility functions, we promote code reuse, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
- **Modularity**: Utilities are designed to be modular, allowing them to be easily integrated into various components of the application.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized utility classes help streamline operations, improving the overall performance of the application.

This structured approach ensures that our project remains organized and efficient, with a clear separation of concerns that enhances both development and maintenance processes.
